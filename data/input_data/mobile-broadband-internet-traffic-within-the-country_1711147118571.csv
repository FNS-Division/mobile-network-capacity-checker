On the other hand, most of the mobile programs do not offer unlimited data volume as in the case of fixed programs, which leads subscribers to make rational use of their mobile phone, related more to navigation and use of applications (mobile apps) . In addition, much of the traffic from mobile devices is done via WiFi networks, and thus, it is counted in the traffic of fixed networks. Another reason of such difference is the considerably increase of Work from Home, conducting to simultaneous use of fixed devices by many family members, which is not the case on mobile devices.","Hellenic Telecommunications & Post Commission","Refers to broadband traffic volumes originated within the country from 3G networks or other more advanced mobile networks, including 3G upgrades, evolutions or equivalent standards in terms of data transmission speeds"
